# Deferred computation

*Deferred computation* is the mechanism by which a Miden program offloads an expensive or
non-native computation — a hash, a signature check, elliptic-curve or big-integer arithmetic — and
emits, in its place, an auditable record of *what was claimed*. That record is a content-addressed
DAG of nodes, committed by a single rolling digest (`DeferredState.root`, the **deferred
root commitment**). The DAG is designed to be verified **externally**: either alongside the Miden
VM's STARK proof, or by a dedicated *Precompile VM* whose proof attests that every committed node
evaluates correctly.

The DAG can be read as a small **program**: each node is a term, and evaluating the deferred root
to `TRUE` proves every claim it transitively references. The framework (`miden_core::deferred`)
owns the data model, the root commitment, and the wire format; individual *precompiles* plug in the
meaning of the nodes.

## Motivation

The deferred subsystem models proof-bound work as a **graph of tagged payloads and structural
edges**. This lets the Precompile VM prove computation at a finer grain — for example, a single
curve or field operation — without re-hashing every intermediate as an opaque standalone assertion.
A calculation like `(a + b) · c` can reference and share sub-results by content address, so
operation-heavy precompiles avoid duplicating the same hashing work.

Each deferred node evaluates to a canonical node; an operation references its operands by their
content address; shared sub-computations are shared in the graph. When the framework needs ordered
accumulation, it represents it as a chain of semantic AND nodes whose root is a statement that must
evaluate to `TRUE`.

The DAG is also intended to match the draft Precompile VM model. In that design, a precompile's
operations and constraints are described as a graph of canonical values, payloads, and joins — so
modelling deferred computation the same way lets a precompile's native host implementation mirror
its eventual constraint implementation. This direction is developed in GitHub discussion #3005.

## Precompile proof shape

The VM STARK proves execution and authenticates the deferred root accumulated for precompile
claims; it does not prove those claims itself. `VmProof` carries that authenticated root alongside
the VM STARK. `TRUE_DIGEST` means there is no remaining obligation, so VM-only proving returns
`ExecutionProof::Complete` without a precompile proof. A non-`TRUE_DIGEST` root produces
`ExecutionProof::Deferred`, which retains the matching singleton `PrecompileWitness` for later
proving. `ExecutionProof::complete` attaches a structurally compatible `PrecompileProof`;
`Verifier::verify` performs structural and cryptographic verification. A successful deferred
outcome returns the exact authenticated root through `outstanding_precompile_root()`. Callers that
require settlement inspect `VerificationOutcome::is_complete()`, not the unverified enum shape.

`DeferredStateWire` remains low-level deferred-state infrastructure. A deferred execution proof
serializes its retained witness using that representation, but the wire is not itself a proof
variant or cryptographic evidence. Encoding preserves representation and accepts cross-artifact
inconsistency. Deferred wire materialization remains fallible; only full verification establishes
proof validity.

## The model

A **node** is a `(tag, payload)` pair, addressed by its 4-felt Poseidon2 **digest**. Identical
content yields an identical digest, so equal subterms are shared automatically (hash-consing).

- A **tag** is a node's identity and constructor: externally, precompile tags are built with
  `Tag::precompile(id, args)`, while `Tag::from_word` is reserved for raw stack/wire decoding. The `id`
  selects the owning precompile; the three immediate felts (`args`) are entirely the precompile's
  to interpret (a discriminant, a data length, a small constant, …). The framework reserves ids `0`,
  `1`, and `2` for itself: `Tag::TRUE = [0, 0, 0, 0]` tags the canonical `TRUE` node,
  `Tag::AND = [1, 0, 0, 0]` tags semantic conjunction nodes, and
  `Tag::CHUNKS = [2, 0, 0, 0]` tags framework-owned opaque byte chunks. No precompile may claim
  these ids. Deferred statement accumulation uses the same semantic `AND` constructor as a
  restricted right-spined chain.
- A **payload** is the node's body, in one of four shapes:
  - the framework `TRUE` sentinel, carrying no data; it is the only zero-payload node;
  - a data payload: one or more 8-felt rate-sized chunks, linearly hashed under the tag. An empty
    data payload is forbidden; precompiles decide whether a data payload represents a scalar,
    digest, message, hash preimage, coordinate, or some other local value;
  - a join payload: two child digests (`lhs`, `rhs`) for anything referential, such as a binary
    operation, predicate, or AND step;
  - a pair-list payload: one or more structural digest pairs for precompile-specific multi-pair
    structures. Pairs are encoded in payload order as 8-felt chunks `lhs || rhs`, and their child
    order is `lhs0`, `rhs0`, `lhs1`, `rhs1`, and so on. Canonical wire encodes the same ordered
    pairs as topological child indices. Empty pair lists are rejected; exact pair-count/arity
    constraints are semantic and enforced by the owning precompile. Budget accounting treats each
    pair as one ordinary 8-felt payload block, in addition to the tag word.

The digest binds the tag in the Poseidon2 capacity, so a node's address commits to *both* its
identity and its body. Every non-empty payload is absorbed as one or more 8-felt blocks under the
node tag.

## Precompiles

A **precompile** is the framework's extension point: an implementation of the `Precompile` trait
that claims one tag id and, within that slice of tag space, defines a *family of node types*
plus the rules that give them meaning. Think of it as a small typed sub-language embedded in the
DAG. Concrete proof-bound precompiles live in the `miden-precompiles` crate; MASM support code
for them is currently treated as internal implementation detail.

A precompile supplies three things:

- `decode(args) -> Option<NodeType>` — *type-checks* a tag: which constructor is this, and what
  structural shape does it carry? This inspects only `Tag::args()`; payload data is not available yet.
  The returned shape drives registration and wire handling, but exact data/pair-list arity is
  semantic and is checked during precompile evaluation:
  - `NodeType::Data` declares a non-empty opaque data payload.
  - `NodeType::Join` declares one payload block containing two child digests.
  - `NodeType::PairList` declares a non-empty list of structural `lhs || rhs` digest pairs.
  - `NodeType::True` is reserved for the framework TRUE sentinel; a precompile must not return it.
- `evaluate(args, payload, …) -> Result<Node>` — computes a node's **canonical form**. The
  common roles are: validate a canonical value represented as data (its canonical is itself),
  evaluate an operation (evaluate the child canonicals, then combine), or check a predicate
  (evaluate operands, return the `TRUE` node on success or fail otherwise). These roles are
  conventions, not a fixed taxonomy — a precompile is free to define multi-ary constructors and so
  on over data, join, and pair-list payloads.
- `init() -> Vec<Node>` — contributes any canonical constant values (e.g. `ZERO`, `ONE`, a curve
  generator) at registry-initialization time.

Precompiles are collected in a **`PrecompileRegistry`**, the framework's dispatcher: it routes each
tag id to its owning precompile and is otherwise indifferent to how the precompile behaves. A
precompile's `id` is derived the same way event IDs are — the name hashed with Blake3 and folded
into a single field element — but in its own domain-separated namespace, so a precompile and an
event of the same name get different ids by construction. The registry rejects misconfigured or
duplicate ids at construction. `PrecompileRegistry::new()` creates an empty low-level registry that
rejects every precompile-owned tag. A `DeferredState` carries the registry it evaluates under, and
`PrecompileRegistry` remains defined in `miden-core` so the framework does not depend on concrete
precompile implementations.

During evaluation the framework hands the precompile a `DeferredContext`, through which it can
`get_node` for a registered digest, `evaluate_digest` a child digest to its canonical digest, or
`register` a freshly-minted helper node into the DAG. Registered helper nodes are validated under
the same registry and must satisfy the ordinary child-closure rules. The precompile never touches
the commitment directly — it supplies only per-node meaning, and the framework drives the
depth-first recursion.

The in-memory `DeferredState` may memoize evaluation results internally. That memoization is
transparent to precompile implementations and is not serialized as trusted state.

## Building the DAG from a program

A program grows and evaluates the DAG through deferred system events. Each event mutates only the
*host-side* `DeferredState`; no register event hands a digest back through advice. Code that later
uses or logs that digest must derive it inside the VM from the same operand-stack payload or ordered
memory chunk sequence in a precompile-specific assembly procedure.

| Event (`adv.*`)            | Operand stack in                 | Effect |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------ |
| `register_deferred`        | `[PAYLOAD_LO, PAYLOAD_HI, TAG, …]` | Decodes `TAG` and registers an operand-stack node, then evaluates it immediately. `TAG` is one 4-felt word. `PAYLOAD_LO || PAYLOAD_HI` is exactly 8 felts: one data chunk, two 4-felt child digests for a join, or one `lhs_digest || rhs_digest` pair for a pair-list node. If the tag arguments define a different required data or pair-list arity, precompile evaluation rejects the node. Structural child digests may reference only already-registered children, except for the implicit `TRUE_DIGEST`. No advice/stack output; code that needs `NODE_DIGEST` computes it inside the VM with one `hperm` over `[PAYLOAD_LO, PAYLOAD_HI, TAG]`. |
| `register_deferred_data`   | `[TAG, ptr, n_chunks, …]`        | Decodes `TAG` and registers a memory-backed node, then evaluates it immediately. For data and pair-list tags, `n_chunks` determines the non-empty payload length; when tag arguments define an exact arity, precompile evaluation checks it. Pair-list chunks are interpreted as `lhs_digest || rhs_digest` pairs. Join tags require `n_chunks == 1` and interpret the single chunk as `lhs_digest || rhs_digest`; `TRUE` is rejected. No advice/stack output; code that needs `NODE_DIGEST` computes it inside the VM from the same `TAG` and ordered chunk sequence. |
| `evaluate_deferred`        | `[NODE_DIGEST, …]`               | Looks the node up, evaluates it to canonical form, and pushes the canonical tag plus canonical payload felts onto the **advice stack**. The tag is first in advice-pop order; for a single 8-felt payload, `adv_pushw adv_pushw adv_pushw` leaves `[PAYLOAD_LO, PAYLOAD_HI, TAG, …]` on the operand stack. `TRUE` emits only `Tag::TRUE`. |
| `evaluate_deferred_tag`    | `[NODE_DIGEST, …]`               | Looks the node up, evaluates it to canonical form, and pushes only the canonical tag onto the **advice stack**. `TRUE` emits `Tag::TRUE`. |
| `evaluate_deferred_payload` | `[NODE_DIGEST, …]`              | Payload-only compatibility event. Looks the node up, evaluates it to canonical form, and pushes only the canonical payload felts onto the **advice stack**. For each 8-felt data chunk, advice is arranged as `HIGH` then `LOW` so `adv_pushw adv_pushw` leaves `LOW` on top and `HIGH` beneath it; chunks preserve canonical chunk order. Join payloads use the same two-word LIFO convention, leaving `lhs_digest` above `rhs_digest` after two `adv_pushw`s. `TRUE` emits no advice. |

`register_*` validate the decoded shape, require non-empty data and pair lists, and check child
closure for structural payloads. Exact data or pair-list arity is enforced only when the tag's
precompile-specific semantics define one. Registration stores the original node under its digest,
evaluates it immediately, and fails immediately if semantic evaluation fails.

### Why the digest is computed inside the VM

A system event is a host hook. Its stack arguments are visible in the VM execution trace, but its
host-side state changes are not constrained by the AIR. In particular, a memory-backed register
event reads `n_chunks` chunks at `ptr` without adding AIR memory accesses that bind the registered
contents to those cells. A proof-relevant digest must therefore be derived with VM instructions:
`hperm` for a stack payload, or `mem_stream` plus `hperm` for the same tag and ordered memory chunk
sequence.

This composes with the verifier:

- the **VM-computed hash** binds the digest to the exact operand-stack values or memory reads
  consumed by those instructions;
- the **VM STARK** authenticates the final deferred root accumulated from those digests;
- the **precompile STARK** proves the aggregate of the ordered constituent roots carried by
  `PrecompileProof`.

Together these pieces bind every settled precompile obligation to data committed by the VM
execution trace.

### Why `evaluate_deferred` is a bare event

A deferred-evaluation event delegates work the VM does not perform and returns the result through
advice, making it an **unbound host hint**. Using it soundly requires re-hashing the returned payload
with VM instructions (and, for the full event, checking the returned tag) and logging a predicate
that `from_wire` re-checks; a VM `eq`/`assert` over two raw advice results proves nothing about their
correctness. Because that obligation is precompile-specific (which predicate to log is the
precompile's business), deferred evaluation is intentionally *not* exposed as a generic safe `sys`
procedure. A precompile-specific assembly procedure must use VM instructions to relate the raw event
output to stack or memory values established independently of that advice. Registration has the
same binding obligation: the wrapper must compute the node digest from the exact stack payload or
ordered memory chunk sequence supplied to the event. A mismatch cannot support a proof-relevant
claim about the registered node.

Predicates are **not** special-cased on evaluation: their canonical is the `TRUE` node like any
other successful predicate. `evaluate_deferred_payload` emits no advice for `TRUE` because `TRUE`
has no payload, while `evaluate_deferred_tag` and full `evaluate_deferred` emit `Tag::TRUE`. A
failed predicate has already surfaced as an error before any felts are pushed.

## The deferred root commitment

The deferred root commitment is a rolling AND-chain. `DeferredState.root` starts at the zero word
(`TRUE_DIGEST`), which is also the digest of the always-present canonical `Node::TRUE`. To fold a
verified
**statement** — any registered digest that evaluates to `TRUE`, not necessarily a primitive
predicate node — the framework registers an AND node
`{ tag: Tag::AND, payload: prev_root || stmt_digest }` and advances the root to that node's digest.
The append path first evaluates the statement under the installed registry and rejects missing or
non-`TRUE` statements. Wire verification does not replay append history; it opens the wire's
implicit root and evaluates that root directly. The digest is structural: even `AND(TRUE, TRUE)` hashes
under the distinct capacity `[1, 0, 0, 0]` and is not equal to `TRUE_DIGEST`, though it evaluates
semantically to `TRUE`.

For low-level wire validation, the deferred check collapses to a single fixed point: rehydrate the
wire and evaluate its implicit root to `TRUE`. When a deferred execution proof is decoded, this
context-aware rehydration checks its retained witness structure; the witness is not cryptographic
evidence. `Verifier::verify` separately verifies the VM STARK and, for a complete proof, any
precompile STARK.

## Wire format and verification

The low-level deferred-state transport format is `DeferredStateWire`, not the in-memory
`DeferredState`. `to_wire` lowers state to a passive, canonical, topologically ordered entry stream:

- wire index `0` is the implicit `TRUE_DIGEST`;
- `entries[i]` has wire index `i + 1`;
- data entries carry literal data chunks;
- join entries encode both children by index;
- pair-list entries encode each pair's children by index;
- structural child indices may reference only `0` or earlier entries;
- empty `entries` opens `TRUE_DIGEST`; a non-empty wire opens the digest of the last entry.

`to_wire` emits a deterministic child-first DFS of the root-reachable closure, so unreferenced
orphans are dropped.

Deferred decoding is context-aware. `DeferredState::from_wire(registry, wire)`,
`PrecompileWitness::from_bytes(bytes, registry)`, and
`ExecutionProof::read_from_bytes(bytes, registry)` require a caller-supplied trusted registry.
State and witness hydration and execution-proof decoding use the fixed `MAX_DEFERRED_ELEMENTS`
ceiling. For bundled precompiles,
callers normally use `miden_vm::read_execution_proof_from_bytes`, which installs
`miden_precompiles::registry()`. Custom-precompile callers use the low-level context-aware decoder
directly. `PrecompileRegistry::new()` is only an empty low-level registry and cannot decode concrete
precompile tags. `Prover` and `Verifier` do not support caller-selected registries.

`DeferredState::from_wire` runs as a structural decode, a canonicality check, and a root evaluation,
validating the wire's own implicit root.

1. **structural** — seed index `0` as the implicit `TRUE_DIGEST`, reconstruct each explicit
   entry (translating structural child indices back to digests), decode its tag, check that the entry
   variant and payload shape match the declared `NodeType`, reject explicit `TRUE`, reject duplicate
   digests, and require structural children to reference only earlier entries;
2. **canonicality** — register decoded entries into a fresh state, set the implicit wire root as
   `state.root`, and require `state.to_wire() == wire`; this rejects dangling nodes,
   non-root-last encodings, and equivalent-but-reordered topological wire;
3. **semantic** — evaluate the implicit wire root under the installed precompiles and require it to
   equal the canonical `TRUE` node. Evaluation may insert canonical/helper nodes in addition to
   the wire nodes.

A wire that yields any integrity error is rejected; a faithful one reconstructs a state whose root is
the wire's implicit root and whose canonical wire output is byte-for-byte identical to the input
wire.

## Status and scope

This framework is now the proof-bound precompile substrate. The VM retains its host-side
`DeferredState` in `ExecutionWitness`, and `log_deferred` advances its root by folding registered
statements with `Tag::AND`. The `miden-precompiles` crate supplies the concrete implementations used
by core-library facades and standard proving. See the
[API contract](./semantics.md#proof-obligations-and-composition) for independent proving, merge and
completion invariants, and completeness checks.

More generic DAG resource accounting remains a follow-up; the external STARK that verifies a
committed DAG, the **Precompile VM**, is described in GitHub discussion #3005.
