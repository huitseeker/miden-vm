/// This type is an implementation detail of the dependency resolver provided by
/// [`super::PackageIndex`].
///
/// A [VersionSet], as implied by the name, provides set semantics for semantic versioning ranges
/// that may also be further constrained by specific content digests that are considered to be part
/// of the set.
///
/// * The empty set is represented as a range that cannot contain any version
/// * The complete (aka "full") set is represented as an unbounded range with an empty content
///   digest filter, equivalent to the semantic versioning constraint `*`
/// * Set intersection is performed by finding the overlap in the ranges of the two sets, and then
///   if either set has a content digest filter, only permitting content digests that are present in
///   both sets. It is not guaranteed that a given content digest is included in the semantic
///   version intersection, rather _either_ the digest or the semantic version of the intersection
///   is used for matching a package.
/// * Set complement is performed by negating the range of versions included in the set. The
///   resulting set will always have an empty content digest filter.
/// * Set containment for a version `v` is determined as follows:
///   * If the semantic version component of `v` is covered by any range in the set, it is
///     provisionally considered to be contained in the set, IFF
///   * If the set specifies a content digest filter, then `v` must have a content digest component
///     that matches that filter.
