# Lifted STARK Verifier

End-to-end verification for the lifted STARK protocol using LMCS
commitments and the lifted FRI PCS. Supports multiple traces of different
power-of-two heights of at least 2 rows via virtual lifting.

Protocol-level overview lives in `miden-lifted-stark/README.md`.

## Entry Points

| Item | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `verify` | Verify a `Statement` |
| `Statement` | A `MultiAir` plus the per-proof inputs (`air_inputs`, optional `aux_inputs`) |
| `MultiAir` | Trusted statement definition: AIR instances, cross-AIR assertions, and a Fiat-Shamir `observe` hook |
| `StarkProof` | Log trace heights + raw transcript data |

```text
verify(config, &statement, proof, challenger)
```

The `statement` carries its `MultiAir` (the AIRs and the cross-AIR assertions
from `eval_external`) plus the statement-owned `air_inputs` and (if any)
`aux_inputs`. The framework absorbs both `air_inputs` and `aux_inputs` into
Fiat-Shamir automatically via `Statement::observe` — callers must pass a
`Statement` carrying the same data on prover and verifier sides.

The proof is read from the provided transcript channel. This crate does not
prescribe the *initial* challenger state used for Fiat-Shamir.

## Fiat-Shamir / statement binding

The caller must produce the same challenger state as the prover — see the
prover module-level docs for the full binding contract.

## Transcript boundaries

`verify` rejects trailing transcript data (`TranscriptError::TrailingData`). If you
bundle extra data in the same transcript, you must manage boundaries yourself.

## Protocol flow

0. Reconstruct `TraceOrder` from the proof's log trace heights and reorder caller AIRs into the proof's ascending-height ordering.
1. Absorb statement-owned inputs via `Statement::observe`, then absorb the instance count and per-instance log trace heights into the challenger.
2. Receive main trace commitment.
3. Sample aux randomness.
4. Receive aux trace commitment.
5. Sample constraint folding challenge `alpha` and cross-trace accumulator `beta`.
6. Receive quotient commitment.
7. Sample OOD point `z` (rejection-sampled outside trace domain), derive `z_next`.
8. Verify PCS openings at `[z, z_next]` for main, aux, and quotient.
9. Reconstruct `Q(z)` from the opened quotient chunks.
10. For each trace instance j, set `y_j = z^{r_j}` and evaluate folded constraints at `y_j`.
11. Accumulate across traces with `beta`.
12. Call `statement.eval_external(...)` once with the global view (challenges, all aux values in instance order, log heights in instance order) and check each returned EF value is zero.
13. Check quotient identity: `accumulated == Q(z) * (z^N - 1)`.
14. Ensure transcript is fully consumed.

## Mathematical background

This section assumes familiarity with STARK verifiers and explains how
*lifting* lets us verify mixed-height traces using a single uniform
opening point and a single quotient identity. All sizes are powers of two.

### Domains and cosets

Let:

- $N = 2^n$ be the **maximum** trace height across all traces.
- $D = 2^d$ be the **constraint degree** (quotient-domain blowup).
- $B = 2^b$ be the **PCS/FRI blowup**, with $D \le B$.
- $g$ be the fixed multiplicative shift (`F::GENERATOR`).

Define subgroups:

$$
H = \langle \omega_H \rangle,\ |H| = N
\qquad
J = \langle \omega_J \rangle,\ |J| = N\,D
\qquad
K = \langle \omega_K \rangle,\ |K| = N\,B
$$

and shifted cosets $gH, gJ, gK$.

### What "lifted traces" mean to the verifier

Suppose instance $j$ has trace height

$$
n_j = N / r_j
\qquad\text{with } r_j = 2^{\ell_j}.
$$

Let $t_j(X)$ be the degree-$<n_j$ interpolant of the trace column (over $H^{r_j}$),
and define the lifted polynomial

$$
t_j^*(X) := t_j(X^{r_j}).
$$

Key facts:

1. $\deg(t_j^*) < N$, so it fits the max-degree regime.
2. For any point $x$, $t_j^*(x) = t_j(x^{r_j})$.
3. Choosing the commitment coset shift as $g^{r_j}$ makes the evaluation domains
   line up: $(gK)^{r_j} = g^{r_j} K^{r_j}$.

#### Uniform-height view

Conceptually, each short trace is "stretched" to height $N$ by repeating it $r_j$
times. From the verifier's perspective every trace behaves like a single
height-$N$ object:

- there is one global out-of-domain point $z$,
- one global "next-row" multiplier $\omega_H$ (the generator of the max trace domain),
- and each trace instance uses a different *projection* of that point.

### How openings at $[z,\ z\cdot\omega_H]$ give per-trace local/next pairs

The verifier samples a single $z$ outside both the max trace domain $H$ and the max
LDE coset $gK$, and sets:

$$
z_{\mathrm{next}} = z \cdot \omega_H.
$$

For instance $j$, define the **virtual** evaluation point

$$
y_j := \pi_{r_j}(z) = z^{r_j}.
$$

Then:

$$
t_j^*(z) = t_j(z^{r_j}) = t_j(y_j),
$$

and for the next-row point:

$$
t_j^*(z_{\mathrm{next}})
  = t_j\big((z\cdot\omega_H)^{r_j}\big)
  = t_j\big(z^{r_j}\cdot\omega_H^{r_j}\big)
  = t_j\big(y_j\cdot\omega_{H^{r_j}}\big).
$$

Since $\omega_{H^{r_j}} = \omega_H^{r_j}$ is the generator of the smaller trace domain,
the pair opened at $[z,z_{\mathrm{next}}]$ is exactly the local/next pair needed
to evaluate AIR transition constraints for that trace.

This is why verifier code computes `y_j = z^{r_j}` and evaluates selectors/periodics
at $y_j$, while requesting PCS openings only at the global points
$[z,z_{\mathrm{next}}]$.

### Constraint folding at the lifted OOD point

For each instance $j$, the verifier:

1. Interprets the opened main/aux values as $(T_j(y_j),\ T_j(y_j\cdot\omega_{H^{r_j}}))$.

2. Computes row selectors at $y_j$ using:

$$
Z_{H^{r_j}}(y_j) = y_j^{n_j} - 1,
$$

and the unnormalized selector formulas (matching `LiftedDomain::selectors_at`):

$$
\mathrm{is\_first}(y) = \frac{Z_{H^{r_j}}(y)}{y-1},
\quad
\mathrm{is\_last}(y) = \frac{Z_{H^{r_j}}(y)}{y-\omega_{H^{r_j}}^{-1}},
\quad
\mathrm{is\_transition}(y) = y-\omega_{H^{r_j}}^{-1}.
$$

3. Evaluates periodic columns at $y_j$ (each period-$p$ column is evaluated at
   $y_j^{n_j/p}$).

4. Folds constraints with challenge $\alpha$ using Horner accumulation:

$$
\mathrm{folded}_j
  = (((c_0\cdot\alpha + c_1)\cdot\alpha + c_2)\cdots)\cdot\alpha + c_k.
$$

5. Accumulates across instances using challenge $\beta$:

$$
\mathrm{acc} \leftarrow \mathrm{acc}\cdot\beta + \mathrm{folded}_j.
$$

Because lifting is composition by $X^{r_j}$, "evaluate then lift" matches
"lift then evaluate": $N_j^*(z) = N_j(z^{r_j})$. The verifier's accumulation
matches the prover's accumulation at the max point $z$.

### Quotient reconstruction at $z$

The prover commits to a single quotient object representing $Q$ on the max quotient
domain $gJ$, sent as $D$ "chunk" polynomials $q_0,\dots,q_{D-1}$ of degree $<N$.

At verification time we open each $q_t$ at $z$ and reconstruct $Q(z)$ via the
barycentric formula in `reconstruct_quotient`:

- Let $\omega_S := \omega_J^N$ be the $D$-th root of unity.
- Let $u := (z/g)^N$.
- Define weights

$$
  w_t := \frac{\omega_S^t}{u - \omega_S^t}.
$$

Then:

$$
Q(z) = \frac{\sum_{t=0}^{D-1} w_t\,q_t(z)}{\sum_{t=0}^{D-1} w_t}.
$$

### The quotient identity

After accumulating all folded constraint evaluations, the verifier checks:

$$
\mathrm{acc} = Q(z)\cdot Z_H(z),
\qquad
Z_H(z) = z^N - 1.
$$

This is the lifted analogue of the classic STARK quotient identity. It works for
mixed-height traces because each instance's constraints were evaluated at its projected
point $y_j = z^{r_j}$.
