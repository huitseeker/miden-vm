//! # FRI Protocol Implementation
//!
//! Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proof for low-degree testing.
//! Proves that a committed polynomial has degree below a target bound.
//!
//! ## Domain Convention
//!
//! This FRI implementation treats inputs as evaluations over the unshifted two-adic
//! subgroup. If the PCS evaluates over a coset `gK`, the shift is absorbed into
//! the polynomial: `Q'(X) = Q(g·X)`. The low-degree test is run on `Q'` using
//! subgroup points.
//!
//! ## Type vocabulary
//!
//! FRI takes its initial domain as a [`LiftedDomain<F>`](crate::domain::LiftedDomain) —
//! the protocol-level LDE object carrying both the LDE subgroup size and the blowup
//! ratio relative to the trace. The unshifted subgroup view is reached via
//! `domain.lde_coset().subgroup()`. Each fold round shrinks the working subgroup by the
//! folding arity, derived via [`TwoAdicSubgroup::shrink`](crate::domain::TwoAdicSubgroup::shrink)
//! (or per-round generator squaring inside the round loop, which is equivalent and avoids
//! re-querying `F::two_adic_generator`). Internal `arity`-th roots of unity used by the fold
//! operations come from `TwoAdicSubgroup::<F>::new(log_arity).generator()`. Routing every
//! two-adic root and every multiplicative coset shift through these encapsulation types keeps
//! `F::two_adic_generator` and `F::GENERATOR` confined to their single canonical sites.
