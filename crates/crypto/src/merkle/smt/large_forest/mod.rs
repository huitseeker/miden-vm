//! A high-performance sparse merkle tree forest with pluggable backends.
//!
//! # Semantic Layout
//!
//! Much like the `SparseMerkleTree`, the forest stores its trees at depth [`SMT_DEPTH`] and then
//! relies on the compact leaf optimization to uniquely store the 256-bit elements that it contains.
//! This is done to both reduce the size of a merkle path, and to reduce the computational work
//! necessary to perform queries into the trees.
//!
//! It also has the benefit of significantly reducing the memory usage for the forest. Even in cases
//! where it relies on a persistent backend, the other peripheral structures are able to be smaller
//! and thus use less memory.
//!
//! # Backends
//!
//! The forest is implemented to rely on the API and contract conformance of an arbitrary
//! [`Backend`] implementation. These backends provide the storage for full trees in the forest, and
//! are the main extension point for the way the forest functions.
//!
//! The [`InMemoryBackend`] provides simple, in-memory storage for the full trees in the forest. It
//! is _primarily_ intended to be used for testing purposes, but should nevertheless be correct and
//! functional for production use-cases if no persistence is required.
//!
//! The [`PersistentBackend`] provides persistent on-disk storage for the full trees in the forest,
//! and is intended to maintain good performance in scenarios where persistence is key or where the
//! forest would grow too large to fit into memory.
//!
//! While any given [`Backend`] may choose to share data between lineages, this behavior is not
//! guaranteed, and must not be relied upon.
//!
//! ## Performance
//!
//! Each [`Backend`] provides the same set of functionality to the forest, but may exhibit
//! significant variance in their performance characteristics. As a result, **any performance
//! analysis of the forest should be done in conjunction with a specific backend**.
//!
//! Nevertheless, we can provide some basic guidelines for getting good performance from this
//! structure:
//!
//! 1. **Batch Operations:** Wherever possible, perform queries and/or updates using batching
//!    operations on the forest. These provide scope for taking advantage of parallelism as much as
//!    possible, and can mask potential I/O latency.
//! 2. **Grouping:** If you have lots of data to apply to the tree, batching operations so that they
//!    share prefixes in the trees in question will yield improved performance by requiring fewer
//!    subtrees to be accessed.
//!
//! Take care to read the documentation of the specific [`Backend`] that you are planning to use in
//! order to understand its performance, potential gotchas, and other such details.
//!
//! # Storing Trees and Versions
//!
//! An SMT forest conceptually performs two roles. Firstly, it acts as a collection that is able to
//! store **multiple, unrelated trees**. Secondly, it is a container for **multiple versions of a
//! given tree**. In order to make it tractable to implement a performant forest with pluggable
//! backends, this type makes an explicit delineation between these use-cases in both the API and
//! the implementation.
//!
//! ## Lineages
//!
//! We term a set of trees, where each tree is derived from changing the previous version, to be a
//! **lineage** of trees. A single lineage contains the information necessary to reconstruct any
//! previous version of the tree, within the bounds of the history that the forest stores.
//!
//! Users must take care to ensure that each lineage identifier is unique, as reuse of these
//! identifiers can result in data corruption and hence queries that return incorrect results.
//!
//! # Tree Identification
//!
//! It is possible for a tree with identical leaves (and hence an identical root) to exist in
//! multiple lineages in the forest. As lineages are stored separately, there needs to be a way to
//! specify the precise instance of a given tree.
//!
//! Trees are thus identified using the [`TreeId`], which combines the **lineage** in which the tree
//! exists with the **version** in that lineage.
//!
//! ## Potential Gotchas
//!
//! The separation of the forest into lineages of trees has a few impacts that a client of the
//! forest must understand:
//!
//! - When using a [`Backend`] that offers data persistence, **only the state of the current version
//!   of each lineage is persisted**, while **the historical data is not persisted**. This is part
//!   of the way the forest is structured, and does not depend on the choice of backend.
//! - It is always going to be more expensive to query a given lineage at **an older point** in its
//!   history than it is to query at a newer point.
//! - Querying **the latest tree in a lineage will take the least time**.
//!
//! # Batch Operations
//!
//! The [`LargeSmtForest::update_tree`] and [`LargeSmtForest::update_forest`] methods are what is
//! known as **batch operations**. In other words, they are performed in one go and only produce a
//! one-stage update to the forest, rather than a sequence of updates.
//!
//! These methods should be used wherever possible (especially preferring `update_forest` over a
//! sequence of `update_tree` calls) as this will allow the forest and its backend to exploit as
//! much parallelism as possible in the updates.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! The following section contains usage examples for the forest. They rely on the included
//! [`InMemoryBackend`] for simplicity, but will work with any conformant [`Backend`]
//! implementation. Each example is designed to build upon the last.
//!
//! ## Constructing a Forest
//!
//! A new forest can be constructed by calling either [`LargeSmtForest::new`], which will use a
//! default [`Config`], or by explicitly providing the config in [`LargeSmtForest::with_config`].
//!
//! ```
//! use miden_crypto::merkle::smt::{ForestInMemoryBackend, LargeSmtForest};
//! # use miden_crypto::merkle::smt::LargeSmtForestError;
//! #
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), LargeSmtForestError> {
//!
//! let backend = ForestInMemoryBackend::new();
//! let forest = LargeSmtForest::new(backend)?;
//! #
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Upon startup, the forest has to read the lineages it knows from the provided storage. If it
//! cannot get this information, it cannot start up properly and the constructor may return an
//! error.
//!
//! ## Adding a Lineage
//!
//! Each tree in the forest belongs to a _lineage_, identified by a [`LineageId`]. In order to work
//! with a lineage in the forest, that lineage first has to be added to it! Adding a lineage can
//! either add the empty tree, or specify a set of modifications on the empty tree to create a
//! starting state.
//!
//! ```
//! # use miden_crypto::merkle::smt::LargeSmtForestError;
//! # use miden_crypto::merkle::smt::{ForestInMemoryBackend, LargeSmtForest};
//! use miden_crypto::{
//!     Word,
//!     merkle::smt::{LineageId, SmtUpdateBatch},
//! };
//!
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), LargeSmtForestError> {
//! # let backend = ForestInMemoryBackend::new();
//! # let mut forest = LargeSmtForest::new(backend)?;
//! #
//! // We can just make some arbitrary values here for demonstration.
//! let key_1 = Word::parse("0x42").unwrap();
//! let value_1 = Word::parse("0x80").unwrap();
//! let key_2 = Word::parse("0xAB").unwrap();
//! let value_2 = Word::parse("0xCD").unwrap();
//!
//! // Operations are most cleanly specified using a builder.
//! let mut operations = SmtUpdateBatch::empty();
//! operations.add_insert(key_1, value_1);
//! operations.add_insert(key_2, value_2);
//!
//! // To add a new lineage we also need to give it a lineage ID, and a version.
//! let lineage = LineageId::new([0x42; 32]);
//! let version_1 = 1;
//!
//! // Now we can add the lineage to the forest!
//! assert!(forest.add_lineage(lineage, version_1, operations).is_ok());
//! #
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Modifying a Lineage
//!
//! A forest is not all that useful if we cannot update it! Modifying a lineage is much like adding
//! a new one, in that we specify operations to be performed on the latest tree in that lineage.
//!
//! ```
//! # use miden_crypto::merkle::smt::LargeSmtForestError;
//! # use miden_crypto::{
//! #     Word,
//! #     merkle::smt::{ForestInMemoryBackend, LargeSmtForest, LineageId, SmtUpdateBatch},
//! # };
//! #
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), LargeSmtForestError> {
//! # let backend = ForestInMemoryBackend::new();
//! # let mut forest = LargeSmtForest::new(backend)?;
//! #
//! # // We can just make some arbitrary values here for demonstration.
//! # let key_1 = Word::parse("0x42").unwrap();
//! # let value_1 = Word::parse("0x80").unwrap();
//! # let key_2 = Word::parse("0xAB").unwrap();
//! # let value_2 = Word::parse("0xCD").unwrap();
//! #
//! # // Operations are most cleanly specified using a builder.
//! # let mut operations = SmtUpdateBatch::empty();
//! # operations.add_insert(key_1, value_1);
//! # operations.add_insert(key_2, value_2);
//! #
//! # // To add a new lineage we also need to give it a lineage ID, and a version.
//! # let lineage = LineageId::new([0x42; 32]);
//! # let version_1 = 1;
//! #
//! # // Now we can add the lineage to the forest!
//! # forest.add_lineage(lineage, version_1, operations)?;
//! #
//! // Let's make another arbitrary value.
//! let key_3 = Word::parse("0x67").unwrap();
//! let value_3 = Word::parse("0x96").unwrap();
//!
//! // And build a batch of operations again.
//! let mut operations = SmtUpdateBatch::empty();
//! operations.add_insert(key_3, value_3);
//! operations.add_remove(key_1);
//!
//! // Now we can simply update the tree all in one go with our changes.
//! let version_2 = version_1 + 1;
//! assert!(forest.update_tree(lineage, version_2, operations).is_ok());
//! #
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Multiple lineages can be modified at once using the [`LargeSmtForest::update_forest`] method,
//! which works very similarly to the [`LargeSmtForest::update_tree`] method shown above.
//!
//! ## Querying a Lineage
//!
//! Modification is just one part of the puzzle, however. It is just as important to be able to get
//! data _out_ of the forest too!
//!
//! ```
//! # use miden_crypto::merkle::smt::LargeSmtForestError;
//! # use miden_crypto::{
//! #     Word,
//! #     merkle::smt::{ForestInMemoryBackend, LargeSmtForest, LineageId, SmtUpdateBatch},
//! # };
//! use miden_crypto::merkle::smt::{TreeEntry, TreeId};
//!
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), LargeSmtForestError> {
//! # let backend = ForestInMemoryBackend::new();
//! # let mut forest = LargeSmtForest::new(backend)?;
//! #
//! # // We can just make some arbitrary values here for demonstration.
//! # let key_1 = Word::parse("0x42").unwrap();
//! # let value_1 = Word::parse("0x80").unwrap();

//! # operations.add_insert(key_2, value_2);
//! #
//! # // To add a new lineage we also need to give it a lineage ID, and a version.
//! # let lineage = LineageId::new([0x42; 32]);
//! # let version_1 = 1;
//! #
//! # // Now we can add the lineage to the forest!
//! # forest.add_lineage(lineage, version_1, operations)?;
//! #
//! # // Let's make another arbitrary value.
//! # let key_3 = Word::parse("0x67").unwrap();
//! # let value_3 = Word::parse("0x96").unwrap();
//! #
//! # // And build a batch of operations again.
//! # let mut operations = SmtUpdateBatch::empty();
//! # operations.add_insert(key_3, value_3);
//! # operations.add_remove(key_1);
//! #
//! # // Now we can simply update the tree all in one go with our changes.
//! # let version_2 = version_1 + 1;
//! # forest.update_tree(lineage, version_2, operations)?;
//! #
//! // As discussed above, trees are identified by a combination of their lineage and version.
//! let old_tree = TreeId::new(lineage, version_1);
//! let current_tree = TreeId::new(lineage, version_2);
//!
//! // The first really useful query is `open`, which gets the opening for the specified key. We can
//! // get openings for the current tree AND the historical trees.
//! assert!(forest.open(old_tree, key_1).is_ok());
//! assert!(forest.open(current_tree, key_3).is_ok());
//!
//! // We can also just `get` the value associated with a key, which returns `None` if the key is
//! // not populated.
//! assert_eq!(forest.get(old_tree, key_1)?, Some(value_1));
//! assert_eq!(forest.get(current_tree, key_3)?, Some(value_3));
//! assert!(forest.get(current_tree, key_1)?.is_none());
//!
//! // We can also get an iterator over all the entries in the tree.
//! let entries_old = forest.entries(old_tree)?.collect::<Result<Vec<_>, _>>()?;
//! let entries_current = forest.entries(current_tree)?.collect::<Result<Vec<_>, _>>()?;
//! assert!(entries_old.contains(&TreeEntry { key: key_1, value: value_1 }));
//! assert!(entries_old.contains(&TreeEntry { key: key_2, value: value_2 }));
//! assert!(!entries_old.contains(&TreeEntry { key: key_3, value: value_3 }));
//! assert!(!entries_current.contains(&TreeEntry { key: key_1, value: value_1 }));
//! assert!(entries_current.contains(&TreeEntry { key: key_2, value: value_2 }));
//! assert!(entries_current.contains(&TreeEntry { key: key_3, value: value_3 }));
//! #
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! There are many other kinds of queries of course, so taking a look at the methods available on
//! [`LargeSmtForest`] is a good starting point.
