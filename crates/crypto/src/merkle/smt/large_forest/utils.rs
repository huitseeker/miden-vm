///

///
/// - inspectable [`LineageMutation`] entries, which expose the affected lineages, requested

///   [`crate::merkle::smt::LargeSmtForest::apply_mutations`].
///
/// The type is parameterized by the backend because different backend implementations may prepare
/// different internal data. For example, an in-memory backend can keep regular SMT mutation sets,
/// while a persistent backend can keep storage-level updates that avoid recomputing the tree walk
/// during application.
