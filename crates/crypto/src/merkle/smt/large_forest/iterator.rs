//! This module contains the implementation of the iterator over the entries of an arbitrary tree in
//! the forest.
//!
//! # Performance
//!
//! The performance of this iterator has a significant dependency on the tree that it is running
//! over. Due to the differing performance characteristics of backends, we cannot provide exact
//! performance bounds, but the following general rules apply.
//!
//! - Iterating over the entries of the **latest tree in a lineage** is going to be **the fastest
//!   possible query**. This depends only on the direct iteration performance of the backend in
//!   question.
//! - Iterating over the entries of **a historical tree is going to be slower**. This is because it
//!   has to do work to merge the entries provided by the history with the entries of the full tree
//!   in order to create a coherent picture of the historical tree.
//!
//! We highly recommend benchmarking the iteration behavior on the concrete workload(s) you are
//! concerned about, rather than trying to statically reason about performance of this iterator.

// ENTRIES ITERATOR

/// An iterator over the entries of an arbitrary tree in the forest, yielding entries in an
/// arbitrary order.
///
/// - If any error occurs during iteration, this is signaled to the user by the iterator yielding
///   `Some(Err(...))`. The user should stop on first error, as the iterator will be in an
///   inconsistent state afterward.
/// - `None` is returned if the true end of the iterator is reached successfully, or at any point
///   after an error has been yielded.
///
/// It is split into two variants for performance, as iterating over a full tree is significantly
/// simpler than iterating over a historical tree. While it would be nice to be able to return one
/// of two different iterators depending on the circumstances of construction, Rust's `impl Trait`
/// bounds do not allow for this.
///
/// The iterator **must never transition between variants** during the process of iteration.
///
