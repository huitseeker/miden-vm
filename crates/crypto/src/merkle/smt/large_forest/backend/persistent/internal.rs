use crate::merkle::smt::large_forest::backend::persistent::WriteBatch;

/// Merges the provided [`WriteBatch`]es into a single batch using efficient raw-memory operations.
///
/// This is intended to be equivalent to `WriteBatchInternal::Append` in the C++ codebase, but that
/// function is not exposed in the C API or the Rust wrapper for RocksDB.
///
/// **This function must be revisited every time the RocksDB crate is updated to ensure that it
/// operates correctly.**
///
/// # `WriteBatch` Layout
///
/// The basic format of a `WriteBatch` is as follows:
///
/// ```text
/// [sequence: u64le][count: u32le][record0][record1]...
/// ```
///
/// Each record contains:
///
/// - A **type tag** (e.g. `kTypeColumnFamilyValue` or `kTypeColumnFamilyDeletion`) which determines
///   how to read the rest of the underlying data.
/// - A **column family ID** `varint32_cf_id` which identifies the column family into which the
///   record will be written.
/// - A **key** `&[u8]` that is the key in the column.
/// - A **value** `&[u8]` that is the value for the given key in the column.
///
/// # Alternatives
///
/// An alternative to this would be to use a transaction-based RocksDB instance instead, and perform
/// the merging using `Transaction::rebuild_from_writebatch`. This is semantically equivalent, but
/// requires involving the whole transaction machinery. It ends up being significantly more
/// heavyweight than this solution, almost doubling the amount of time the batch forest update takes
/// to run.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// - If the data for either the left or right batch is corrupt, as this indicates a bug in the
///   underlying RocksDB implementation and should not be continued with.
