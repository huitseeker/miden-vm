// MAST FOREST ID
// ================================================================================================

// `MastForestId` is an opaque handle to a [`MastForest`] in some forest store such as the
// `TraceGenerationContext::mast_forest_store`. It is not a content-derived or stable identity for a
// forest, and must not be compared or reused across stores or trace contexts. It is analogous to
// `MastNodeId`, which is meaningful only within one forest's node store.
newtype_id!(MastForestId);

// SPARSE MAST FOREST
// ================================================================================================

/// A sparse replay view over a single source [`MastForest`]'s [`MastNodeId`] space, retaining only
/// the nodes visited during execution.
///
/// Unlike [`MastForest`], which stores nodes contiguously in an `IndexVec`, a [`SparseMastForest`]
/// uses a `BTreeMap` so that it can preserve the original [`MastNodeId`]s of the source forest
/// while omitting nodes that were not visited. A [`SparseMastForest`] is not an independent forest
/// shape: it shares its source forest's ID space, and is intended to back re-execution of the same
/// program. Lookups by the original [`MastNodeId`] continue to resolve to the correct
/// [`MastNode`]s.
///
/// In addition to the visited nodes, a [`SparseMastForest`] may also carry digest-only entries for
/// nodes that were referenced during execution but never actually entered (e.g. the not-taken
/// branch of a split, or the children of a join that only need to contribute their digests to the
/// parent's trace row). These entries let trace generation read the digest without having to copy
/// the full child node, and they make accidental entry into a pruned node a clean
/// `get_node_by_id` miss rather than a partially-populated node.
