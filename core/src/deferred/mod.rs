//! Content-addressed deferred computation for VM hints.
//!
//! Deferred events let programs commit opaque statements during execution and leave their
//! semantic checks to installed [`Precompile`]s. The framework stores those commitments as a DAG
//! of [`Node`]s and a deferred root commitment that verifies by evaluating every logged statement
//! to TRUE.
//!
//! `miden-core` owns the data model, registry, state, and wire validation; the processor only
//! provides system-event plumbing.
