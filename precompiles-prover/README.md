# miden-precompiles-prover

`miden-precompiles-prover` proves and verifies STARK-backed deferred precompile
claims for Miden VM execution proofs.

The crate is an internal workspace component. Its supported integration entry
points are the root-level deferred proving and verification helpers used by
`miden-prover` and `miden-verifier`; the chiplet/session modules remain
crate-private.

## What's here

The implementation translates a VM `DeferredState` into the precompile prover's
session representation, generates the chiplet traces for the supported deferred
nodes, serializes the resulting STARK proof into `DeferredProof::Stark`, and
verifies that proof against its public deferred root.

## Build

```sh
make check
make test-fast
```
