//! Hasher controller trace constants and types.
//!
//! This module defines the structure of the hasher controller trace, including:
//! - Trace selectors that determine which hash operation is being performed
//! - State layout for the Poseidon2 permutation (12 field elements: 8 rate + 4 capacity)
//!
//! The hasher chiplet supports several operations:
//! - Linear hashing (absorbing arbitrary-length inputs)
//! - 2-to-1 hashing (Merkle tree node computation)
//! - Merkle path verification
//! - Merkle root updates (for authenticated data structure modifications)
