//! ACE circuit integration for the Miden multi-AIR proof.
//!
//! The public API is split by responsibility:
//! - `recursive` builds the encoded circuit consumed by the recursive verifier.
//! - `multi_air` combines the per-AIR ACE DAGs into one proof-order-aware circuit.
//!
//! The cross-AIR LogUp boundary identity is checked outside the circuit as
//! `sum_i(n_i * sigma_prime_i) + c_boundary = 0`, where `sigma_prime_i` is AIR `i`'s
//! normalized committed LogUp sum and `n_i` is its trace length.
