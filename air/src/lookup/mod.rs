// LOOKUP AIR
// ================================================================================================

/// A declarative LogUp lookup argument.
///
/// Shaped the same way as `p3_air::Air<AB>`: generic over the builder
/// the caller picks, and evaluated once per logical "row pair" (the
/// constraint path visits every row symbolically, the prover path visits
/// every concrete row).
///
/// The trait carries both the static *shape* (column count, payload
/// width bound, bus-id upper bound) and the `eval` method that actually
/// emits the interactions. Adapter constructors take a `&impl
/// LookupAir<Self>` and read the shape via the trait — the `LB` type
/// parameter is pinned to the adapter itself, so there is no
/// ambiguity when the blanket `impl<LB: LookupBuilder> LookupAir<LB>
/// for MyAir` implementations apply.
///
/// ## Contract
///
/// - [`num_columns()`](Self::num_columns) must match the number of `LookupBuilder::next_column`
///   calls issued from [`eval`](Self::eval) — the adapter advances its internal column index each
///   time the closure returns and will panic (or produce undefined constraints) on a mismatch.
/// - [`max_message_width()`](Self::max_message_width) must be ≥ the widest payload any message in
///   the AIR emits. It counts **only** contiguous payload slots — the bus identifier is handled
///   separately through the precomputed bus-prefix table.
/// - [`num_bus_ids()`](Self::num_bus_ids) must be ≥ the largest bus ID any message in the AIR
///   emits, plus one; the adapter precomputes exactly that many bus prefixes and indexes into the
///   table with `bus_id as usize`.
/// - The auxiliary trace must have a positive row count. Its single committed value is the
///   normalized sum `sigma_prime = sigma / n`, bound by the all-row cyclic recurrence.
pub trait LookupAir<LB: LookupBuilder> {
    /// Number of permutation columns this argument occupies.
    fn num_columns(&self) -> usize;

    /// Per-column upper bound on the number of fractions a single row can push.
    ///
    /// Length must equal [`num_columns()`](Self::num_columns). Each entry is the
    /// Mutual-exclusion-aware max: the largest active branch count taken across all mutually
    /// exclusive groups inside the column, not the sum of every structural
    /// `add` / `remove` / `insert` / `batch` push site.
    ///
    /// The prover-path adapter uses this to size the dense per-column fraction buffer.

    ///
    /// Typical sources are statement-supplied terminals and public-input-driven seed emissions
    /// (kernel ROM init, block hash seed, log-deferred terminals).
    /// These close out buses whose per-row [`eval`](Self::eval) contributions alone
    /// don't cancel.
    ///
    /// Default is a no-op so AIRs with no boundary contributions don't need to override it.
