/// The memory submodule assumes that the following invariants hold:
/// - Multiple reads in the same clock cycle to the same address are allowed, but
/// - Multiple writes in the same clock cycle to the same address are *not* allowed

/// These invariants are not enforced by [`Memory`] explicitly, but are expected to be upheld by all
/// processor operations (i.e. all variants of the [`miden_core::operations::Operation`] enum). This
/// is a consequence of the design of the memory chiplet constraints, which allow for multiple reads
/// but not multiple writes in the same clock cycle to the same address.
